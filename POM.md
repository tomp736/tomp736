Welcome to my Personal Operating Manual! 

This document offers a glimpse into what it's like to collaborate with me, a real-live human with a background as a technology professional.

## About Me "Identity Stack"

As a kid, I enjoyed taking old computers and stuff and tried to make something better out of them. Sometimes I had a plan, mostly I didn't, but I enjoyed the process of imagining the possibilities, implementing, and when finished moving on. Once the possibilities were gone, I lost interest and moved on to the next thing. In my professional life, not much is different. I thrive when motivated by curiosity and enjoy technical challenges. It is a critical part of what motivates me to come into to work everyday.


- **Role**: Technology Professional, Real Live Human
- **Skills**: C# .Net, Linux, Containers, Kubernetes, Cloud Engineering. After being a .Net Web Application Developer for 10 years, I am glad to have found the time and motivation to become certified in linux and kubernetes and study cloud-native development. I also know how to exit vim, have been called an "expert" in Microsoft Excel, and can bake an acceptable pumpkin pie.
- **Values**: Autonomy, curiosity, teamwork, simplicity. I value having autonomy so that I can contribute to topics/technologies I am most interested in at the time. Passion comes and goes so it is important for me to be able to strike when the iron is hot. I prefer robust simple solutions.
- **Interests**: Good food, Nice Colleagues, Interesting Workload, positive Work/Life Balance. I used to snowboard, play lacross, and bike a lot. I enjoy watching plane crash mysteries and true crime.

## How You Can Help Me

- **Motivation**: Inspire my curiousity. Assuage my fears. Provide some incentives when the work is not great. Tell me why I should care. Paid time off, tickets to a game, conference passes, etc - all work well as incentives and recognition.
- **Goal Setting**: Provide clear and well-defined goals. I love hitting targets. It helps me focus my energy and effectively prioritize especially in complex projects or environments with lots of uncertainties. 
- **Regular Updates**: Checking in regularly to provide updates. It helps keep me engaged with the teams progress and clarifies how I can align my workload to help meet them.
- **Big Changes**: Advanced notice is appreciated. Trust, routine, and stability are important to me. It gives me time to adapt more smoothly to new situations and helps me maintain trust and a positive attitude when changes have negative outcomes.

## My Working Style

- **Collaboration and Support**: I look out for my team members when making decisions and am quick to offer help and support in technical and non-technical matters. I expect the same from others.
- **Structure and Organization**: I have a strong preference to working within clearly defined structures and processes. No plan is not a plan I can work with in the long term. Too much work left to "interpretation" doesn't work for me. Pocesses should be agreed upon, documented, and clearly communicated to achieve consistant and auditable outcomes.
- **Decision Making**: I am often cautious when decision-making and it can take me a long time to get all the facts straight before commiting. I would pref decision-making being a collaborative process as it helps me with being more informed and confident in the decision outcomes.

## Communication with Me

- **Preferred Methods**: I prefer written communication (email, messaging) for clarity and record-keeping. When meetings are necessary, book a slot in my calendar.
- **Feedback and Interaction**: I value gentle, constructive feedback delivered in a supportive manner. I appreciate regular feedback.
- **Integrity**: Communicate with integrity. Be honest, ethical, transparent, and respectful.
- **Availability**: I think it is important to be available for messaging during standard working hours, and hold myself to that standard. The "right to disconnect" outside of work hours.
- **Asking for Help**: If you’re facing challenges or need support, please reach out. I’m here to help in any way I can and value open, supportive communication.
- **Non Negotiables**: Do not involve me in jokes or statements about others at their expense. It is extremely inappropriate and damaging to my view of the project/organization and I have no desire to contribute to them.

## Conclusion

This POM is shared to foster understanding and build strong working relationships. Thank you for taking the time to learn how I work!
